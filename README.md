Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joel, a passionate 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student at VIT Chennai. I have a keen interest in web development and consider myself a MERN Full Stack Developer. Over the course of my academic journey, I've had the pleasure of working on numerous exciting projects, showcasing my skills and creativity.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on honing my skills in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Exploring the realms of artificial intelligence fascinates me, and I'm eager to apply these concepts to real-world projects.

ðŸŒ± Learning is a continuous journey, and right now, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of AI and NLP. The possibilities seem endless, and I'm excited to see where this knowledge will take me.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration on innovative projects. If you have any exciting ideas or if you're looking for a teammate to bring your vision to life, feel free to reach out!
